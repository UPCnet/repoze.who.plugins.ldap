Description: repoze.who.plugins.ldap -- LDAP Authentication for WSGI Applications
        
        repoze.who.plugins.ldap is an LDAP plugin for the identification and
        authentication framework for WSGI applications, repoze.who, which acts as WSGI
        middleware.
        
        It provides you with an straightforward solution to enable LDAP support in your 
        applications. Yes, you read well: "straightforward", "LDAP" and
        "applications" are in the same sentence. In fact, you may make your application
        LDAP-aware in few minutes and with few lines of code.
        
        Another great news is that this package is *fully* documented and provides you
        with a working and documented demo project.
        
        See the `docs` subdirectory of this package for more information, or browse
        the online documentation <http://code.gustavonarea.net/repoze.who.plugins.ldap/>.
